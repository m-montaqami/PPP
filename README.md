## PPP
This github page contains a python version program for precise point positioning.
The core algorithm of this software is designed to process smartphone observations. As part of my MSc-Thesis, I used Flask framework in order to build a web-based version of my software. You can install this software by following the instructions in the 'help.txt' folder.
